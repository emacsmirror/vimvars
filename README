The accompanying code is intended to provide support for VI-style
mode lines in Emacs.  The idea is that using this code, you can make
your Emacs editor obey the vi-oriented settings your collaborators put
in the file, so that when you start working on their project, your
code is correctly laid out from the start.

To use this library, just put vimvars.el in a directory on your path
and add this to your .emacs file:

;;; Basic VIM tolerance
(require 'vimvars)
(add-hook 'find-file-hook 'vimvars-obey-vim-modeline)
